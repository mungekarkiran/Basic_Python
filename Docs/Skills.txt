Method 1:
Model Architecture:
A custom CNN model is defined with several Conv2D layers, BatchNormalization, and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting and ensure better generalization.
A Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) block is added to recalibrate channel-wise feature responses, enhancing the model's representational power.

Loss Optimization:
An exponential decay learning rate schedule is implemented to adjust the learning rate during training.
Callbacks like ModelCheckpoint and ReduceLROnPlateau are used to save the best model and reduce learning rate when the model stops improving.

Method 2:
Model Architecture:
A custom CNN model is defined with several Conv2D layers, BatchNormalization, and Dropout layers to prevent overfitting and ensure better generalization.
An attention mechanism is added to help the model focus on the most relevant parts of the input images.
