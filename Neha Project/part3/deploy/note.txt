FourCC is a 4-byte code used to specify the video codec. The list of available codes can be found in fourcc.org. It is platform dependent. The following codecs work fine for me.
In Fedora: DIVX, XVID, MJPG, X264, WMV1, WMV2. (XVID is more preferable. MJPG results in high size video. X264 gives very small size video)
In Windows: DIVX (More to be tested and added)
In OSX: MJPG (.mp4), DIVX (.avi), X264 (.mkv).
