Image Matching Challenge 2025

Reconstruct 3D scenes from messy image collections.

Dataset Description
Building a 3-D model of a scene given an unstructured collection of images taken around it is a longstanding problem in computer vision research. Your challenge in this competition is to generate 3-D reconstructions from image sets showing different types of scenes and accurately pose those images. This year, weâ€™re challenging you to determine how images should be grouped together or discarded, in addition to reconstructing 3D scenes.

This competition uses a hidden test. When your submitted notebook is scored, the actual test data (including a sample submission) will be made available to your notebook. Expect to find roughly 1,300 images in the hidden test set.

train_labels.csv A list of images in the training data, including ground truth.

dataset: The unique identifier for the dataset.
scene: The unique identifier for the scene.
image: The image filename.
rotation_matrix: The first target column. A 3x3 matrix, flattened into a vector in row-major convention, with values separated by ";". Sample values are random.
translation_vector: The second target column. A 3-D dimensional vector, with values separated by ";". Sample values are random.
train_thresholds.csv A list of thresholds for evaluation.

dataset: The unique identifier for the dataset.
scene: The unique identifier for the scene.
thresholds: A list of thresholds (in meters) for evaluation, separated by ";".
[train/test]/[dataset]/*.png A set of images taken from one or more locations. For instance, train/imc2024_lizard_pond contains images from two different scenes, lizard and pond. A folder may also contain single images that do not correspond to any scene ("outliers").

[train/test]/[dataset]/LICENSE.txt The license for each dataset.

Note: The published test folder contains a subset of scenes from the training set. It is provided solely for example purposes. The folder will be populated with different data when submitting a notebook for scoring.

sample_submission.csv A valid, randomly-generated sample submission with the following fields:

image_id: A unique identifier for the row. Must be present in your submission file.
dataset: The unique identifier for the dataset.
scene: The unique identifier for the scene. In the submission file, this label is arbitrary and should be ignored. In your submission, it will indicate which images belong together (for a given dataset).
image: The image filename.
rotation_matrix: Same as above.
translation_vector: Same as above.
