    "1. What is Python?\n",
    ">Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and analyze data. Python is a general-purpose language, not specialized for any specific problems, and used to create various programmes.\n",
    "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are the key features of Python?\n",
    ">- Easy to Code\n",
    ">- Open Source & Free Software\n",
    ">- Support for GUI\n",
    ">- Object-Oriented Methodology\n",
    ">- High-Level Language\n",
    ">- Highly Portable Language\n",
    ">- Integrated by nature\n",
    ">- Extremely Dynamic\n",
    ">- Extensive Array of Libraries\n",
    ">- Supportive of Other Languages\n",
    ">- Community Support\n",
    ">- Multipurpose\n",
    ">- Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Explain the difference between Python 2 and Python 3.\n",
    ">- Unicode. By default, Python 3 encodes strings using Unicode rather than ASCII.\n",
    ">- Range functions. Python 3’s range() function replaced Python 2’s xrange() function, improving performance when iterating over sequences.\n",
    ">- Exception handling. Python 3’s exceptions are enclosed in parentheses, while Python 2’s exceptions are enclosed in notations.\n",
    ">- Integer division. In Python 3, the result of an integer division is a float value. In Python 2, the decimals are truncated.\n",
    ">- Annotations. Python 3 supports type annotations, whereas Python 2 does not. This feature can help with reading and maintaining code.\n",
    ">- Print statement. Python 3 replaces the print statement with a print function.\n",
    ">- Syntax. Python 3’s syntax is considered easier to understand and more readable than Python 2’s, which uses more complex syntax.\n",
    ">- Backward compatibility. Python 3 is not backward compatible with Python 2, whereas Python 2 is backward compatible with previous versions of Python; in other words, code written for Python 1.x can still run on Python 2 without significant modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. How is memory managed in Python?\n",
    "> Classify memory management in Python in one of two ways: dynamic allocation or static allocation. Dynamic allocation occurs as the program is running. This means that as the program operates, it can dynamically determine where to allocate memory while reusing and releasing it. Static memory allocation happens before the running of a program, predetermining the amount and distribution of the memory, and without the ability to reuse memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write a Python code snippet to swap two variables without using a temporary variable.\n",
    "> \n",
    ">```\n",
    ">a, b = 10, 20\n",
    ">a, b = b, a\n",

    "6. What are Python Decorators?\n",
