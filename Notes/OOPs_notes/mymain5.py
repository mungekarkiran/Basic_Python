# Abstraction class

# A class that consists of one or more abstract method is called the abstract class. 
# Abstract methods do not contain their implementation. 
# Abstract class can be inherited by the subclass and abstract method gets its definition in the subclass. 
# Abstraction classes are meant to be the blueprint of the other class.
